# Core Development Guidelines

## Technical Bounds (First Priority)

**Never assume. Always verify.** Before making architectural changes:
- Check official documentation for tool requirements
- Verify files aren't auto-loaded or required by tools
- Test behavior before removing/modifying system files
- Stay within technical constraints of all tools (Cursor IDE, databases, etc.)

## Code Quality
- Write clean, maintainable, well-documented code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic only
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Prefer composition over inheritance

## Error Handling
- Always handle errors gracefully
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors appropriately for debugging
- Never expose sensitive information in error messages

## Security
- Never hardcode secrets or API keys
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Follow principle of least privilege

## Performance
- Optimize for readability first, then performance
- Use caching where appropriate
- Avoid unnecessary database queries
- Profile before optimizing

## Git Practices
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Use feature branches for new work
- Review code before merging
