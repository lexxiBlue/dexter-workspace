# Technical Bounds & Requirements Verification

**THIS RULE APPLIES TO EVERYTHING** - All actions, changes, and decisions must respect technical bounds.

## Core Principle

**Vet and verify user requests. Be well-informed before executing.** Never blindly follow requests. Always verify technical requirements, check documentation, and understand implications before acting.

**This is not optional** - It applies to:
- **User requests** - Vet every request for technical feasibility and requirements
- Code changes
- File modifications
- Architectural decisions
- Tool integrations
- Database changes
- Configuration updates
- Any system-level change

## Before Executing Any User Request

1. **Verify Technical Requirements**
   - Will this break tool requirements? (e.g., Cursor IDE needs `.mdc` files)
   - Are there hard constraints I need to respect?
   - What are the technical implications?

2. **Check Documentation**
   - What do the official docs say about this?
   - Are there examples or patterns to follow?
   - What are best practices?

3. **Understand Implications**
   - What will this change affect?
   - Are there dependencies I need to consider?
   - Will this stay within technical bounds?

## Before Any Architectural Change

1. **Check Official Documentation**
   - Verify tool requirements (e.g., Cursor IDE requires `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files)
   - Check if files are auto-loaded or required by the system
   - Understand dependencies and constraints

2. **Verify Current Behavior**
   - Test what happens if you remove/modify a file
   - Check if tools auto-load files from specific locations
   - Understand the actual vs. assumed behavior

3. **Research Before Refactoring**
   - Don't assume files are "just documentation" - they may be required
   - Check if tools have hard requirements vs. soft preferences
   - Verify compatibility before making changes

## Red Flags (Stop and Verify)

- About to remove/modify files in `.cursor/` directory
- Changing file formats or locations that tools might depend on
- Assuming files are "just for humans" without verification
- Making changes based on assumptions rather than documentation

## Required Actions

- **Before removing files**: Verify they're not required by tools
- **Before changing structure**: Check if tools auto-load from specific paths
- **Before architectural changes**: Research official requirements first
- **When uncertain**: Ask clarifying questions or verify in documentation

## Examples

❌ **Wrong**: User says "move `.mdc` files to database" → I immediately do it
✅ **Right**: User says "move `.mdc` files to database" → I verify Cursor IDE requirements first, then explain why we need them in place

❌ **Wrong**: User requests architectural change → I execute without checking tool requirements
✅ **Right**: User requests architectural change → I vet it against technical bounds, check docs, then execute if safe

❌ **Wrong**: "Let's move `.mdc` files to database - they're just markdown"
✅ **Right**: "Cursor IDE auto-loads `.mdc` files from `.cursor/rules/` - we need them there. Use database as source of truth with sync."

❌ **Wrong**: "This file seems redundant, let's delete it"
✅ **Right**: "Verify this file isn't required by Cursor IDE or other tools before removing"

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Checked official documentation for requirements
- [ ] Verified file is not auto-loaded by tools
- [ ] Tested behavior if file is removed/modified
- [ ] Confirmed compatibility with existing systems
- [ ] Understood actual vs. assumed behavior
