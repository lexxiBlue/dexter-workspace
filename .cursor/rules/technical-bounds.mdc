# Technical Bounds & Requirements Verification

## Core Principle

**Never assume. Always verify.** Before making architectural changes or removing/modifying system files, verify the technical requirements of the tools and systems in use.

## Before Any Architectural Change

1. **Check Official Documentation**
   - Verify tool requirements (e.g., Cursor IDE requires `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files)
   - Check if files are auto-loaded or required by the system
   - Understand dependencies and constraints

2. **Verify Current Behavior**
   - Test what happens if you remove/modify a file
   - Check if tools auto-load files from specific locations
   - Understand the actual vs. assumed behavior

3. **Research Before Refactoring**
   - Don't assume files are "just documentation" - they may be required
   - Check if tools have hard requirements vs. soft preferences
   - Verify compatibility before making changes

## Red Flags (Stop and Verify)

- About to remove/modify files in `.cursor/` directory
- Changing file formats or locations that tools might depend on
- Assuming files are "just for humans" without verification
- Making changes based on assumptions rather than documentation

## Required Actions

- **Before removing files**: Verify they're not required by tools
- **Before changing structure**: Check if tools auto-load from specific paths
- **Before architectural changes**: Research official requirements first
- **When uncertain**: Ask clarifying questions or verify in documentation

## Examples

❌ **Wrong**: "Let's move `.mdc` files to database - they're just markdown"
✅ **Right**: "Cursor IDE auto-loads `.mdc` files from `.cursor/rules/` - we need them there. Use database as source of truth with sync."

❌ **Wrong**: "This file seems redundant, let's delete it"
✅ **Right**: "Verify this file isn't required by Cursor IDE or other tools before removing"

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Checked official documentation for requirements
- [ ] Verified file is not auto-loaded by tools
- [ ] Tested behavior if file is removed/modified
- [ ] Confirmed compatibility with existing systems
- [ ] Understood actual vs. assumed behavior
